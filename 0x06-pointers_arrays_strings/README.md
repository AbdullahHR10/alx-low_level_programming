## Files

1. **0-strcat.c:** Concatenates two strings.
2. **1-strncat.c:** Concatenates two strings up to a specified number of bytes.
3. **2-strncpy.c:** Copies a string.
4. **3-strcmp.c:** Compares two strings.
5. **4-rev_array.c:** Reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. **5-string_toupper.c:** Changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
7. **6-cap_string.c:** Capitalizes all words of a string.
8. **7-leet.c:** Encodes a string into 1337.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding pointers and their usage.
- Understanding arrays and how to use them.
- Differentiating between pointers and arrays.
- Manipulating strings and understanding string manipulation techniques.
- Understanding variable scope.

## Requirements

- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- No usage of global variables.
- Maximum 5 functions per file.
- No usage of standard library functions. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc., is forbidden.
- Allowed to use _putchar.
- Do not push _putchar.c; it will not be considered.
