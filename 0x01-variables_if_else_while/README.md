# ALX SE Programme Project 0x01 - C Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains solutions to various C programming tasks as part of the ALX SE Programme Project 0x01. Each task is solved with a separate C file.

**Author:** Abdullah Hussein

## Files

1. `0-positive_or_negative.c`: Prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
2. `1-last_digit.c`: Prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
3. `2-print_alphabet.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. `3-print_alphabets.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
5. `4-print_alphabt.c`: Prints the alphabet except 'q' and 'e' in lowercase, followed by a new line.
6. `5-print_numbers.c`: Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
7. `6-print_numberz.c`: Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
8. `7-print_tebahpla.c`: Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
9. `8-print_base16.c`: Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
10. `9-print_comb.c`: Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

## Learning Objectives

- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
- How to use the while loop
- How to use variables with the while loop

- What is the ASCII character set
- What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

## Requirements

### General

- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
