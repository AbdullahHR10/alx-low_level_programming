# ALX SE Project 0x04 - C Programming: More Functions, More Nested Loops

This project contains solutions to various C programming tasks as part of the ALX SE Project 0x04. Each task is solved with a separate C file and it
focuses on expanding understanding and practice of functions and nested loops in C programming.

**Author:** Abdullah Hussein

## Files
- **0-isupper.c**: Checks for uppercase character.
- **1-isdigit.c**: Checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- **2-mul.c**: Multiplies two integers.
- **3-print_numbers.c**: Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9.
- **4-print_most_numbers.c**: Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9 without 2 and 4.
- **5-more_numbers.c**: Prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14.
- **6-print_line.c**: Draws a straight line in the terminal.
- **7-print_diagonal.c**: Draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
- **8-print_square.c**: Prints a square.
- **9-fizz_buzz.c**: Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of three with "Fizz", multiples of five with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
- **10-print_triangle.c**: Prints a triangle.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
- What are header files and how to use them with #include

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- Don’t forget to push your header file
