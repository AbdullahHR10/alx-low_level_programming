# ALX SE Programme Project 0x00 - C Hello, World

This project contains solutions to various C programming tasks as part of the ALX SE Programme Project 0x00. Each task is solved with a separate script or C file.

**Author:** Abdullah Hussein

## Files

1. **0-preprocessor**: Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
2. **1-compiler**: Script that compiles a C file but does not link.
3. **2-assembler**: Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.
4. **3-name**: Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
5. **4-puts.c**: Prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle", followed by a new line.
6. **5-printf.c**: Prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art", followed by a new line.
7. **6-size.c**: Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
8. **100-intel**: Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
9. **101-quote.c**: Prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type `gcc main.c`
- What is an entry point
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements

### C

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

### Shell Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
